2. 🔐 OTP Login via Email
This security feature sends a One-Time Password (OTP) to the user’s email when they log in. The user must enter the correct OTP to access the app.

How it works:
When the user enters their email and password, the app sends an OTP to their email address. The user must enter the OTP on the next screen. If the code is correct, they are granted access; otherwise, access is denied.

📌 Why it’s useful:
This adds a layer of security to protect user information and prevent unauthorized access to personal budgeting data.
